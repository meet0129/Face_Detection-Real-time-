# ðŸŽ¯ Real-Time Face Detection using Deep Learning (VGG16 + OpenCV)

A powerful real-time face detection system built with **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and a custom-trained **VGG16** model. It leverages deep learning for accurate face detection from live webcam streams, with support for **data augmentation** using Albumentations and visual insights via Matplotlib. This project is optimized for GPU processing (tested on Nvidia 1650 Ti).

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** â€“ Programming language
- **OpenCV** â€“ Image processing & webcam handling
- **UUID** â€“ Unique labeling for dataset generation
- **TensorFlow** â€“ Deep learning framework
- **VGG16** â€“ Pretrained CNN model for face detection
- **Matplotlib** â€“ Visualization of data and training results
- **Albumentations** â€“ Fast and flexible data augmentation
- **Nvidia 1650 Ti** â€“ GPU acceleration for faster training and inference

## ðŸ“¸ Project Highlights

- Detects faces in real-time from webcam feed
